### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**davidaristotle2012/davidaristotle2012** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my final project for the CS109 course. Please check out the datascience projects repo to see my projects. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently CS109 Data Science from Harvard. The CS109 repo contains my work
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to gain more practical experience, i.e. apply what I learned to open-ended problems.


- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about Why I moved fromm Engineering to Data science.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I was once in the national team of Table Tennis of Mauritius, and I like cosplaying.
