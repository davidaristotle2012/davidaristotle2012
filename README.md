### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my final project for a Data Science course. Please check out the datascience projects repo to see my portfolio.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently CS109 Data Science from Harvard. The CS109 repo contains my work
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to gain more practical experience, i.e. apply what I learned to open-ended problems.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Why I moved from Engineering to Data science.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I was once in the national team of Table Tennis of Mauritius.

Please note: This is my portfolio from 2021, and may not represent my skill level now.
